- Grid doesn't seem to work
    - Assuming it worked, it would still need to autoscale as you zoom out in steps

- Zooming out causes the lines to dissapear since it's essentially a 3d plot
    - Keep camera panning, but have zoom function just scale the data instead of moving the camera?
    - Might be an anti-aliasing issue, will have to look into shaders

- No autoscaling, need to add one
    - Seems pretty easy given how performant it currently is, but need to subsume all the plotting code into its own class 
      so that it has awareness of the full data
