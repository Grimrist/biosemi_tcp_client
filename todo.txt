' Welch spectrum does not update after initial capture
- Implement separate data worker thread so that the thread can terminate itself if needed. 
    - Potentially allow changing which data we're reading in real time.
- Change aggregator classes (settings, model?) to have accessors so we no longer use direct references
- Determine ADC range to properly display uV values
- Try detecting fft amplitude values
