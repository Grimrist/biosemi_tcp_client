- Thread seems to die or lock up without any exception, presumably due to a performance issue? Use trace or detect thread termination somehow.
- Honestly the issue above is just a program structure problem, I need to fix the way the entire data thread works
- Welch spectrum update rate makes entire system lag -- need to make the whole graphing system more performant
    - This is mostly a limitation of the library, but I could dynamically respond to low performance by changing the update rate
- Implement separate data worker thread so that the thread can terminate itself if needed. (done)
    - Potentially allow changing which data we're reading in real time. (maybe)
- Change aggregator classes (settings, model?) to have accessors so we no longer use direct references
- Add time scale control to the time plot, as high frequencies become impossible to look at
    - pgplot allows writing my own range controller, so I have to look into it
    - Would be nice if you could just scroll to adjust the size without it breaking the autoscroll
- Fix division by zero during runtime (normalization calculation, logarithm)
- Maybe add a debug tab where I can more quickly configure certain values, only shows up with the -d flag on
- Read tACS manual to determine how to configure and send a signal
    - Equipment must be switched on before connecting, as undefined currents are output upon switch on
    - TTL levels
        - Low: 0-0.4V
        - High: 2.4-5.25V
        - Minimum current: 3mA
    - Level-triggered (not edge)
    - Active high (high-level triggers stimulation)
    - Minimum length of trigger: 1ms
