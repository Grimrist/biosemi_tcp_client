- Change aggregator classes (settings, model?) to have accessors so we no longer use direct references
- Maybe add a debug tab where I can more quickly configure certain values, only shows up with the -d flag on
    - I added a debug thread, so this should be much easier to implement via slots
- Potentially use CUDA to speed everything up
    - Testing showed it to actually be slower, surprisingly
- Add controller thread to finally solve all the annoying issues trying to start/stop the workers
    - I tried to not do this and wound up paying the price because I _need_ the debug thread to open its socket before the data capture starts
    - Decided this isn't worth fixing because actual users won't be using the debug mode, but it is slowly driving me insane
- Separate file reading functionality from DebugWorker to provide the functionality to regular users
- Somehow fix time-domain plot so that it can properly auto range to where the data is when it's clipped out of view
    - Probably need to move all the logic into a class inherited from the plot widget so I can make the autorange button use the full data
    - This is mostly done I just haven't actually added the autorange

- Rewrite PlotCurveItem to handle multiple sets of data with multiple colors all at once
    - This will probably involve either glMultiDrawArrays() or GL_LINES, not clear which is better
    - Needs to handle multiple colors, using glColorPointer
