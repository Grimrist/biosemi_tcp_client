- Welch spectrum update rate makes entire system lag
    - This is mostly a limitation of the library, but some optimization was achieved by using numpy arrays as much as possible
- Potentially allow changing which data we're reading in real time. (maybe)
- Change aggregator classes (settings, model?) to have accessors so we no longer use direct references
- Maybe add a debug tab where I can more quickly configure certain values, only shows up with the -d flag on
    - I added a debug thread, so this should be much easier to implement via slots
- Read tACS manual to determine how to configure and send a signal
    - Equipment must be switched on before connecting, as undefined currents are output upon switch on
    - TTL levels
        - Low: 0-0.4V
        - High: 2.4-5.25V
        - Minimum current: 3mA
    - Level-triggered (not edge)
    - Active high (high-level triggers stimulation)
    - Minimum length of trigger: 1ms
- Potentially use CUDA to speed everything up
    - Testing showed it to actually be slower, surprisingly
- Use the internet's method for the 24bit interleave because I'm clearly not smart enough
- Add button to disable serial pulses
- Notify serial port of capture ending (disable the pulse)
- Add controller thread to finally solve all the annoying issues trying to start/stop the workers
