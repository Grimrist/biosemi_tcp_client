- Handle errors due to dropped packets/data loss
- Add multi-channel display (currently doesn't allow changing channel live properly, also need y axis offset?)
- Determine ADC range to properly display uV values
- Try detecting fft amplitude values (probably through separate thread? Need to figure out if Python does global variables)
