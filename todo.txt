- Thread seems to die or lock up without any exception, presumably due to a performance issue? Use trace or detect thread termination somehow.
- Honestly the issue above is just a program structure problem, I need to fix the way the entire data thread works
- Welch spectrum update rate makes entire system lag -- need to make the whole graphing system more performant
- Update client to allow switching between FFT and time graph seamlessly
    - Currently shows both, need to link up button with the hide/show function on the widget
- Implement separate data worker thread so that the thread can terminate itself if needed. 
    - Potentially allow changing which data we're reading in real time.
- Change aggregator classes (settings, model?) to have accessors so we no longer use direct references
- Add time scale control to the time plot, as high frequencies become impossible to look at
- Set up custom classes for QDoubleComboBox in order to provide more useful signals for threshold setup
- Fix division by zero during runtime (normalization calculation, logarithm)
