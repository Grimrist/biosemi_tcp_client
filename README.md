** Not functional **
This branch contains my attempt at implementing glMultiDrawArrays to reduce lag while plotting, but it is not currently functional as I haven't quite learned how to use the OpenGL library

# Real-time BioSemi ActiView TCP client
This is a real-time Python interface designed to receive, plot, and eventually emit signals based on incoming EEG data. This data is sourced from the TCP server included in BioSemi's ActiView client.

It is currently a work-in-progress, so please refrain from using it in a live environment.
