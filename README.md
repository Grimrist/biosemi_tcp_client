# Real-time BioSemi ActiView TCP client
This is a real-time Python interface designed to receive, plot, and eventually emit signals based on incoming EEG data. This data is sourced from the TCP server included in BioSemi's ActiView client.

It is currently a work-in-progress, so please refrain from using it in a live environment.
